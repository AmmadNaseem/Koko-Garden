# KOKO Garden - MEVN Stack
 Koko Garden is a MEVN stack project that allows users to register and donate trees, and view their donated trees on a map using Mapbox markers. The frontend of Koko Garden is built using Vue.js, a popular JavaScript framework for building single-page applications. The frontend provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to register, login, donate trees, and view their donated trees on a map. The backend of Koko Garden is built using Node.js and Express, which provide a robust and scalable server-side platform for building web applications. The backend uses MongoDB as the database to store user data, tree donation data, and other relevant information. The application uses Mongoose, an object data modeling library, to interact with the MongoDB database. The Mapbox API is used to display the donated trees on a map. The application uses the Mapbox JavaScript library to add markers to the map that represent the location of the donated trees. Users can view the map to see where their donated trees are located, and they can also view information about each tree by clicking on its marker. Koko Garden provides a range of features to enhance the user experience. Users can register for an account, login, and donate trees using a simple and intuitive interface. They can view their donated trees on a map, and see information about each tree such as the species, age, and location. They can also view the total number of trees donated by all users, and the total amount of donations received. In conclusion, Koko Garden is a MEVN stack project that allows users to register, donate trees, and view their donated trees on a map using Mapbox markers. It is a powerful and scalable web application that provides a seamless user experience for users who are passionate about reforestation and preserving the environment.
